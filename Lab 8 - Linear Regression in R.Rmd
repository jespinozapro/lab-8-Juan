```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Question 3
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

salmon <- read_csv("salmon_imports.csv")
```

```{r}
# Question 4
# Scatter plot
salmon_plot <- ggplot(salmon, aes(x = Year, y = salmon_fresh)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Salmon Imports", title="Juan's Graph")

salmon_plot
```

Data does not appear to be linear, not all points fall on a diagnal line

```{r}
# Question 5
# Model for linear regression
salmon_model <- lm(salmon_fresh ~ Year, data = salmon)

salmon_model

# salmon(imports) = -14982940 + 7550*year
# slope is negative indicating a downward trend. 

```

```{r}
# Question 6
plot(salmon_model)
# Residuals = normlly distributed
# no concern for heteroscedastity or outliers

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(salmon_model)
```

```{r}
# Question 7
summary(salmon_model)

salmon_summary <- summary(salmon_model)
salmon_summary

# Year predicts salmon imports
# R-squared is the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model
# What proportion of variance is not explained?
```

```{r}
# Question 8

salmon_final_graph <- ggplot(salmon, aes(x = Year, y = salmon_fresh)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = TRUE, size = 0.5, color = "gray20") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(1990, 2017)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "U.S. Annual Fresh Salmon Imports\n(1,000 pounds)")
